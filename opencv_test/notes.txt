Resources:
1. OpenCV on Raspberry
https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/programming/install-opencv

2. OpenCV C++ package (Following only this will work)
https://vegastack.com/tutorials/how-to-install-opencv-on-ubuntu-20-04/

3. The make file after enabling cross compile was throwing the below error:
/usr/bin/ld: /tmp/ccUQTWfm.o: undefined reference to symbol '_ZTIPKc@@CXXABI_1.3'
/usr/bin/ld: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6: error adding symbols: DSO missing from command line

So I had to add the library -lstdc++ in order to link the standard C++ library
